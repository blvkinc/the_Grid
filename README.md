# THE GRID
An experimental, browser-based simulation of a mechanical destination board known from Airports.

This WebApp is connected to the "New York Times API": Each time a word is clicked, the display begins to print a random headline from the NYT-article-archive, containing that word. This allows an experimental, playful exploration of the contemporary history.
