"The Grid" is an experimental simulation of a mechanical destination board known from Airports

This experimental WebApp is connected to the "New York Times API": Each time when the user clicks a word, the display begins to print a random headline from the article-archive from the NYT, containing the word that has been clicked. This allows an experimental exploration of the contemporary history.
